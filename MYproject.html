        <h1>Evaluating the use of socio-economic factors in dissecting the horror of knife crime </h1>
        <h2>Aims:</h2>
        <p>Investigating to yield a deeper understanding of what economic factors drive the patterns of knife crime, through a series of advanced data analyses; looking through a global lens first and then delving into a ‘case study’ of London and its recent history. </p>

        <p>I scraped the data from two sources, merged and cleaned the data with python.
            The colour is coded in, the darker the point the higher Gini coefficient .
            I was able to run a regression through Vega-lite achieving an R value of 0.34,
            showing a moderate level of correlation between the variables. Proving a countries gini coefficient does play a role in its Knife death rate"

        <p> 
            I then scraped from a further source, again then merging and cleansing via colab, this chart is a plot for my seond socio-economic statistic unemployment rate.
            We see a smaller R value in the ‘weak’ qualification, highlighting that unemployment may not be a strong enough indicator for knife rates, on the global scale at least.

        <h3>Deeper Look into the Uk's knife crime problem</h3>
        <p>The Uk has been faced with a severe knife problem for years now,</p>  
        <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>  <div class="chart" id="Chart4"></div>
        <p>I then moved my focus to strictly the UK and its capital in particular, with neither of the first two 
            Scraped www.finder.com knife crimes then, https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/greaterlondon/ for population
            I choose to demonstrate the borough by borough knife crime data with these two choropleth maps to allow for easier quick intuitive ideas to be drawn from them.
            It highlights similarities (correlation) between the two variables definitely within the central to northern region
            I chose ahc rate as it allows for house prices to affect the measures and so gives a fairer report on the London population, and would be something I would recommend to use as we see house prices continue to sky rocket 
            </p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div>
        <p>I used the same data from the two chloropleths and plotted them against each other, additionally I was able to run a regression, 
            we see perhaps a smaller R2 value then imagined, however still arguing that there is definitely a positive relationship between 
            AHC poverty rate and knife crime across London
            The squares are coloured apon area of London, and I have added a tooltipand viewing its relationship.

        <p>Source ONS</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart6"></div>
        <p>This is my first plot of England as a whole, coloured depending on region. Again this data was downloaded from the ONS so only needing slight cleaning in excel. From it we see London year on year having 
            the largest knife crime rate however we do observe a 9 % decrease in its rate over the observe period. Potentially highlighting need to look elsewhere with regards to prevention. We see rate grow by 
            90.9% in the north east and 109.75% in the East of England. An issue to the true integrity of this plot however is slightly in question as the greater Manchester police belive they were actually under 
            recording knife crimes pre 2013 and so the north wests unfortunate growth rate may not be as serious as the graph eludes.
        </p>
        <p>Source Home Office Official, and ONS </p> 
        <div class="chart" id="Chart7"></div>
        <p>This plot was intended to visually and clearly showcase the size of Englands knife problem and how it scales back with no other weapon choice coming close apart from when we see 'poision or drug based' homocides rocket to 200 in 2003. 
            We observe a 68.7 % increase in knife based homocides however this is not statisitically significant enough to draw from without offsetting for population change.
            However the other means of homicide staying roughly around the same actual value highlights the scale of the knife problem we face in this country

<h3>Data</h3>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The abhorrent nature of the act in question is potentially the reason for why it’s very hard to pin down the reasoning behind a knife crime to an economic measurement,
     however; ofcourse some have more of an effect than others. Income inequality both on the global scale, nationally and on a micro scale </p>
