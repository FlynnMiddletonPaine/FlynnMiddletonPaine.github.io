        <h1>Using socio-economic factors to disect the horror of knife crime </h1>
        <h3>Aims:</h3>
        <p>Investigsting to gain a deeper understanding of which economic factors drive the statistis of knife crime,
            through a series of advanced data analyses; looking on a global scale and then delving deeper
             with a 'case study' of England and its recent history </p>
        </div>

        <div class="Area">
        <h3>Knife Crime on a International Scale</h3>
        <p>The first chart aims to explain what the effect of a main standard of living component,
             a countries income inequality coefficient has on the said country’s stabbings death rate.
              We see an overall positive trend with an R2 value of 0.34 showing moderate correlation.</p>

        <p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZjLfGgGtz-4F74VJG3AW3jIJWnG43Roe?usp=share_link">Python Notebook</a></p>
        <p>I scraped the data from wise voter.com, unfortunately not all countries had a gini coeff available and most of these are smaller countries with potentially higher stabbings rates.</p>

        <p>Again, with similar parameters, but using unemployment rate against a country’s stabbings death rate. Likewise, we see some correlation but in this instance weaker, with an R value of 0.18.
             Expressing that unemployment rate is an indicator, but not as strong of a tell as gini coefficient is for stabbing rates.</p>

        <h3>Deeper Look into the UK's Knife Crime Problem</h3>
        <p>
            I placed two London Borough choropleth maps side by side to enable quick and intuitive observations to be drawn from an easily understood visual. </p>  
        <h3>Choropleth Maps</h3>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>  <div class="chart" id="Chart4"></div>
        <p>From the global analyses carried out we saw income inequality playing a role in knife crime rates - I wanted to investigate the same within London, 
            however this time I used AHC poverty rate which allows for housing costs, 
            which I felt was requireed when considering London with it's housing costs boom seen over the last few decades. 
            We see similarities with both knife crime and poverty rates across both, but specifically in the central to northern region.</p>
        <h3>Chart 3</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div>
        <p>
        <p>I then looked to plot these statistics to gather ‘mathematical backup’ in using these maps, 
            doing so we observe an R2 value of 0.33 again showing a standard of living marker providing moderate correlation with knife crime.
            To create lag I used a crime rate dated a year lated than the AHC poverty rate.
            The points are coloured by region to produce a greater in-depth knowledge of London’s knife crime profile. </p>

        <h3></h3>
        <h3>Chart 4</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart7"></div>
        <p>The idea behind this chart was a striking visualisation to portray the sheer extent of knife crime in modern England. 
            It shows no other weapon coming close to knives except in 2003 when we see 'poison or drugs' leap to around 200 homicides.</p>
        <h3>Chart 5</h3>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart6"></div>
            <p>This chart looks to educate its audience regarding the history of knife crimes in England by region.  
                In highlighting London, we see the highest knife crime rate year on year. From 2010-2021 we see a 25.7%  fall, 
                confirming more concerning growth rates elsewhere – as seen in the Northeast, where crime rates grew by 90% and also in the east, where they more than doubled. </p>
        <p>The data for Chart 4 & 5 was downloaded straight from an ONS csv fil, however it was in a very strange format over multiple sheets in excel and so resulted in some challenging manual cleaning in excel. 
            Additionally Manchester police acknowledged they had been under reporting knife crimes up to late 2017. 
            Implying, that the 43% growth rate the graph shows is unfortunately, quite the over estimation in real terms. </p>
            <p><a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn04304/#:~:text=In%20the%20year%20ending%20March,higher%20than%20in%202010%2F11.">CSV download for chart 5 & 6 </a></p>    
        </p>
        <h3>API loop</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart8"></div>  <div class="chart" id="Chart9"></div>  
        <p>Here I looked to utilise two ONS API’s to help strengthen and add dimensions to my previous charts. 
            We see England disagreeing with the positive relationship between unemployment rate and knife crime which we had identified on an international scale. 
            Chart 5 shows England’s knife crime rate growing from 2011 to 2021 but the API shows unemployment rate drastically falling in the same period. 
            However, observing London during the same timespan we can see it responds similarly to the earlier regression with definite correlation.</p>
        <p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ht8VAKb2FR_ttsh02ReFol-GWd2hjXvf">Colab for Loop </a></p>
        <p>I created a loop on colab to download the two API’s, a great attribute to this technique is that the data will refresh automatically as soon as you re-run the code, 
            allowing for further analysis to be made.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The abhorrent nature of the act in question, is potentially why it’s particularly hard to equate the reasons behind knife crime to an economic measurement. 
    However, of course some economic factors do play a role, but their weaker regression coefficients mean I cannot confindently attribute knife crime patterns to one of them. 
    Potentially, the idea surrounding knife crime and the WHY? Lends itself to psychological based study. However, a key motivation and why I choose this subject was to look further into the knife crime ‘epidemic’ of London and to attempt to discover if it is at the level the tabloids and Mr Trump promote it to be - and unfortunately it is. 
    We see year on year incredibly high knife crime statistics for such a developed capital, even at a fair population rate.</p>
